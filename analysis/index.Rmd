Supplementary code for publication. A large proportion of the figures shown in
this publication can be obtained directly from values in the main tables.


Upon publication, a link to a comprehensive set of files, including bigWig
files, will be provided.

Main tables and analysis can be generated running this code. 

See GitHub repository for more information about software requirements.
This website was generated using [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/),
an R package for science reproducibility.

# Publication figures

* [Figure 1](fig_01_quantitative_chip.html). High levels of H3K27m3
and H2AUb broadly cover the naïve pluripotent genome.
* [Figure 2](fig_02_x_chromosome.html). X chromosome in naïve hESCs 
accumulate exceptional amounts of H3K27m3 without a globally repressive function.
* [Figure 3](fig_03_h3k27m3_groups.html). H3K27m3 is adaptive to gene expression
changes between naïve and primed pluripotent state and contributes to repression
of non-state specific genes.
* [Figure 4](fig_04_intermediate.html). Loss of H3K27m3 in naïve hESCs derepresses
a set of genes that drive hESCs towards a rare naturally ocurring intermediate
pluripotent state.
* [Figure 5](fig_04_intermediate.html). Loss of H3K27m3 in naïve hESCs 
activates trophectoderm and placental gene expression programs.

# Supplementary data and analyses

* [Master gene table](master_gene_table.html). Notebook with the code that 
generates the master gene table. 
* [Master bins table](master_bins_table.html). Notebook with the code that 
generates the master bins table.
* [Replicates analysis](sup_01_replicates.Rmd). Notebook with some figures
showing replicates data.

# Main data files

* [Gene table](../data/meta/Kumar_2020_master_gene_table_rnaseq_shrunk_annotated.zip).
 Contains histone mark values across 5kb regions around gene TSS in the hg38 genome, RNA-seq
 plus statistics on differentially decorated promoters and differentially expressed
 genes across conditions. Extra annotations on Court 2017 bivalency, lineage
 marker genes and H3K27m3 bivalency group are added.
* Bins table. Gathers histone mark values across 10kb windows in the hg38 genome,
plus statistics on differentially decorated regions across conditions.
